Multi timer that can count time back from your input number (seconds) to 0.
I'm using here threading do make possible to do a new input and to run a new timer during first one is working.
threading solve operations one in the moment and than moves to next operation in different process. So if you have two for loops
threading will do both of them at the same time, not waitin till the end of one of them. But step by step just one operation in moment.
As alternative you can use multiprocessig. It solve both tasks as parallel processes. It use each core of processor for each task at the same time
so tusk will be solved faster than in threading. But cost for it is that you use as many cores of your processor as many parallel task you have
and you must to be careful with it.

def settime(message):
  message =int(input())
  for i in range (message):
    
    print(threading.currentThread().getName(), message-i)
    time.sleep(1)
  print("done")
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for i in range(3):
        my_thread = threading.Thread(target=settime, args=(i,))
        my_thread.start()
